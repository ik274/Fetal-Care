Maternal care involves in providing healthcare for the pregnant women as well as the unborn children. During and 
after pregnancy both mother and neonatal are affected with different complications. Furthermore, complications 
during pregnancy, such as hypertensive disorders or gestational diabetes, may be associated with subsequent health 
problems in the pregnant woman's later life [1,2,3]. As a result, maternity care is crucial for preventing 
complications in pregnant mother and neonatal. So, regular inspection is essential for detecting abnormalities and 
preventing further complications [4]. 
Our project enables us to monitor the health of both the mother and the fetal using the biosensor (ADS1293) we 
are implemented in our device. Our device picks up ECG signal for both maternal and neonatal and using ICA to 
remove the noise form the received signal. Then the ECG signal is converted to fourteen parameter such as 
“Heart Rate”, “Heart Rate Variable”, “P-axis”, “QRS” etc. for both mother and neonatal [5]. These parameters 
enable us to monitor the Prenatal Care and moreover depending on the age we can “Heart Rate”, “Heart Rate 
Variable”, “P-axis”, “QRS” of maternal and fetal ECG . Using the WIFI module built in our device we extract 
and send the data to the firebase and from there we snatch the data for processing and after using dedicated 
filters we can extract the required data for identification of the ECG signal. After field testing, we compared our 
filtered data with the locally available statistics and found above 90% accuracy. Moreover we reduced the cost 
drastically for our device to be available for everyone [6].
Prenatal pathology is frequently identified at the onset of symptoms in infants; however, early diagnosis, before 
birth or in the first weeks of pregnancy, is made relatively late in Bangladesh, according to experts. Our scientific 
contribution will present a practical solution that establishes a dependable tool to identify cardiac malformations 
early. During the perinatal period, watch changes in heart sounds, heart rate, and the fetal electrocardiogram 
(ECG), which indicates the electrophysiological activity of the fetal heart. Fetal abnormalities during fetal growth, 
such as fetal distress and intrauterine hypoxia, can be identified using fetal ECG waveform analysis.
